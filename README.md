# flask_exp_v2

initially started as a mild interest in Python based web development and back end programming, but ventured down several months learning JavaScript of which (according to Github) is now the dominant language for this app.

a lot has changed, and pages, scripts that i am not so interested in have since been removed. the remaining portions of the app, and the most important ones for me are the calendar and tax_year portions.

they basically merged data from MySQL and google calendar API from my login to produce graphs from Highcharts, with customized user defined parameters for the column names.

notable functionality in a nutshell: 

1. using Python's numpy and pandas library to structure fetched data, to organize, index and translate before rendering on the client side. 
2. ajax functionality with user inputs to decrease calling the server from the client's perspective, and having to reload the page. 
3. employing CRUD methods (create, read, update, delete) from the client side regarding stored data and the clients preferences.

python and javascript work well together.
