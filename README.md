# flask_exp_v2

initially started as a mild interest in Python based web development and back end programming, but ventured down several months learning JavaScript of which (according to Github) is now the dominant language for this app.

a lot has changed, and pages, scripts that i am not so interested in have since been removed. the remaining portions of the app, and the most important ones for me are the calendar and tax_year portions.

they basically merged data from MySQL and google calendar API from my login to produce graphs from Highcharts, with customized user defined parameters for the column names.

every input available to user has some CRUD method employed with it, hence the high amount of JavaScript now.
